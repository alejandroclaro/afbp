What is Alex's Firewall ByPasser?
=================================

 Alex's Firewall ByPasser is another TCP tunnel for HTTP proxies.

 It allow network connections over HTTP proxies. This should work under all
 POSIX complaint systems and all proxies allowing https CONNECT.

 It have been tested for MSN Messenger, emule, bittorrent, ftp(passive only), 
 yahoo messenger, irc(xchat) and firefox on Fedora Core 3, FreeBSD 6.0 and
 MacOSX.

Why I made another Firewall ByPasser?
======================================

 A short answer, because I think I can make one more useful (see features).

FEATURES:
=========

 * multi-thread design:

   It can handle a huge number of simultaneous connections without problems.

 * multiple proxies:

   It use a list of available proxies to make connections. So every connection 
   can be done over a different proxy.

 * ability to check proxy lists:

   It is able to check the proxies before real use. This feature can be used
   to clean and optimize a proxy list.

 * curses interface:
 
   It have a nice 'top' like curses interface.

 * daemon mode:

   It is able to run in background & quiet mode. 
  
 * socks4 and socks5 protocol support:

   Partial support for Socks4 and Socks5. Only CONNECT method (Socks4 & Socks5)
   and NO AUTHENTICATION (Socks5) is implemented at this time, but it is enough
   in most of the cases (future versions will implement complete support
   of both protocols).

Future versions FEATURES:
=========================

 * Complete implementation of Socks4 and Socks5 protocols.
 
 * Besides the socks server, I will make a dynamic library version 
   able to overload the connect() libc function. So application without 
   support for Socks4 or Socks5 will be able to pass over the firewall too.
    
 * Nice installation scripts (no autotools).

 * An improved curses interface.

 * SSL support.

 * IPv6 support.

Limitations:
============

 Alex's Firewall ByPasser should work with every HTTP proxy, with the following exceptions:

   * MS Proxies with NTLM authentication. NTLM is a proprietary authentication method from Microsoft,
     not a standard authentication method. 

   * HTTP/1.0 and HTTP/1.1 Proxies without the CONNECT method. 

Requirements:
=============

Version 0.5.0 and above:

 * pthread library    (Posix 1003.1c compatible system).
 * ncurses            (http://www.gnu.org/software/ncurses/ncurses.html).

Version 0.1.0 - 0.4.1:

 * pthread library    (Posix 1003.1c compatible system).

Compiling and Installation:
===========================

Type this:
   
	make

Become root and type:

	cp fbpss /usr/local/bin/.

  you can change /usr/local/bin/ to your prefer binary directory (eg. ~/bin/). 

Quick Usage:
============

 - To run in standard mode
   (socks server on 1080 port with curses user interface)

 # fbpss proxy.list

 - To run socks server on daemon mode (background & quiet) on port 8080
 
 # fbpss proxy.list -dp8080

 Note that 'proxy.list' is a required argument. For syntax of the 
 proxy.list file check list.example file in the same directory of this 
 README.

 - Configure your application to use Socks4(a) or Socks5 proxy server on host
   127.0.0.1 and port 1080 [or the port you choose with the '-p' command 
   line parameter (eg. 8080)].
